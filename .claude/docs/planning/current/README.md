# Current Planning Documents

This folder contains planning documents for projects in **active development**.

## Lifecycle

Documents in this folder should be **moved to `/completed/`** when implementation is finished and delivered.

## Updates

Update documents regularly to:
- Check off completed tasks (`[x]`)
- Add notes about discoveries and decisions
- Track progress through phases
- Document any changes from original plan

See `.claude/docs/processes/planning_docs.md` for detailed guidance.
